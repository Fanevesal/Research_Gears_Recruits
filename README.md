# Research_Gears_Recruits

Welcome to **Research_Gears_Recruits**, the ultimate playground for tech enthusiasts who love to tinker, hack, and innovate. This repo is based on **Sokoni Africa**, and it's your sandbox to inspect, break, fix, and reimagine a full-stack marketplace app.

## Objective

Your mission (should you choose to accept it):

1. **Peek Under the Hood**

   * Explore the codebase, get to know the architecture, and understand the magic behind the scenes.

2. **Spot the Flaws**

   * Hunt for bugs, performance bottlenecks, and security loopholes.
   * Make notes like a true code detective.

3. **Upgrade, Rebuild, or Innovate**

   * Refactor, optimize, or totally reinvent modules.
   * Migrate old-school code to modern frameworks.
   * Build your own version and make it stand out.

4. **Plug in Your Own APIs**

   * The existing backend is hosted on a VPS with a sandbox/sample API.
   * Use any tech stack for frontend.
   * Document your API integration with realistic terminal examples.

5. **Document Your Work**

   * Log all changes, fixes, and upgrades.
